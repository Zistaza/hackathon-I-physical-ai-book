# Terminology Reference: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Core Concepts

### Vision-Language-Action (VLA) System
- An integrated system that connects vision processing, language understanding, and action execution components to enable robots to respond to natural language commands

### Vision Processing Module
- Processes visual input from cameras and sensors to understand the environment

### Language Processing Module
- Processes natural language input to understand commands and intentions

### Action Execution Module
- Executes physical actions on the robot based on processed commands

### Command Interpretation
- Represents a processed natural language command ready for action execution

### Robot Action
- A single action that the robot can execute

### Object Detection Result
- Result from processing visual input to identify objects in the environment

### World State
- Current representation of the environment including detected objects and robot position

## Technical Terms

### OpenAI Whisper
- Speech recognition model used for converting spoken language to text

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
- Middleware for robotics applications providing communication between different components

### NVIDIA Isaac SDK
- Software development kit for robotics applications, particularly for perception and navigation

### Isaac Sim
- NVIDIA's robotics simulation environment

### Cognitive Planning
- Using LLMs to interpret natural language commands and generate sequences of robot actions

### Voice-to-Action Pipeline
- Processing chain that converts spoken language to executable robot actions

### Natural Language Command
- Human-readable command expressed in natural language that the system can interpret

### Action Sequence
- Series of robot actions generated from interpreting a natural language command
