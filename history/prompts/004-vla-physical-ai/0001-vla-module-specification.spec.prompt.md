## Prompt

specs/004-vla-physical-ai/spec.md

## Response snapshot

Successfully created a comprehensive specification for Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics with user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete VLA module specification with 4 user stories, 12 functional requirements, and 6 success criteria for educational content
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/004-vla-physical-ai/spec.md, specs/004-vla-physical-ai/checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.plan to create implementation plan for VLA module
- 🧠 Reflection: Clear specification with well-defined user scenarios and measurable outcomes enables effective planning and implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; all metadata fields were populated correctly and file was created successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All required fields filled, proper routing to feature directory
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard specification creation prompt
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): none needed - process worked correctly
