## Prompt

complete all remaining tasks of module 2

## Response snapshot

Successfully completed all remaining tasks for Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). This included adding troubleshooting and best practices sections to all four chapters, performing final quality assurance review, and updating all task completion markers in the tasks.md file. All four chapters (Digital Twins in Physical AI, Physics Simulation with Gazebo, High-Fidelity Environments with Unity, and Sensor Simulation for Humanoid Robots) are now complete with consistent terminology, cross-references, and proper Docusaurus formatting.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: All tasks for Module 2 have been completed, with documentation for digital twins, Gazebo physics simulation, Unity environments, and sensor simulation now ready for use
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: 6 files modified/created across documentation and task tracking
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Comprehensive documentation for the digital twin module has been successfully completed with all required components and quality standards met

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All tasks completed successfully
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): N/A
